# 2019_SIOP_ML_Comp

Upload your end-to-end solution syntax under your team folder (from data cleaning to model training to producing final predictions on the testing set). 

We will test the replicability of your solution and make these public upon the SIOP conference.

We will also clean this readme, include cool things in it like the data as we go.
